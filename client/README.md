Really enjoyable task.

I have been trying to deploy to render for a good few hours but everytime I try, it asks me to enter credit card info! (No thanks lol) I am on the free hobby one, and choose free too when deploying, but doesn't want to work. I have no idea why.

The form is workin perfectly too, and is being submitted to the database. The routers are working perfectly, the get methods are working perfectly. Everything works fine. I would want to implement a delete option for entries on the database from the page, but wasn't sure how I would go about doing that, so any pointers to that would be perfect!

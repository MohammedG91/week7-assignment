Really enjoyable task. The only thing I struggled/struggling on is the doing a get request to and showing the data on the path I created. I have used placeholder, so my routes are working, as when you click the link the correct info shows. The endpoints have been made and are working correctly when I check the endpoint urls, but i'm not sure how to go about doing the get request and displaying it on the page.

I have been trying to deploy to render for a good few hours but everytime I try, it asks me to enter credit card info! (No thanks lol) I am on the free hobby one, and choose free too when deploying, but doesn't want to work. I have no idea why.

The form is workin perfectly too, and is being submitted to the database. Just need to figure out the method of how to get the data from my endopint and display it. The path and endpoint is already created and working properly.
